Hi Guy,

It's not public yet but since you have asked: yes, log4j should become a 
jakarta project in the next few days.

There are now two new mailing lists: log4j-dev@jakarta.apache.org and 
log4j-user@jakarta.apache.org which replace the old log4j-dev@log4j.org and 
log4j-public@log4j.org mailing lists. The members of the old lists have 
been automatically subscribed to the corresponding list on 
jakarta.apache.org. The CVS repository has also moved to Apache.

There is a strong push to rename the package to "org.apache.log4j". I have 
already committed to do this for the next major log4j release scheduled for 
1Q 2001. If you have a good reason to oppose a name change, then let us 
know so that we can raise the issue with the apache group.  This is your 
chance to speak up.

Some Apache members have suggested abandoning the name "log4j" altogether. 
I personally don't have a problem with that since I don't really like the 
name log4j. I have proposed the name "cat" (for cat-egory) or equivalently 
jakarta-cat. The package hierarchy would start at "org.apache.cat." Other 
names/proposals are most welcome. Ceki

My vote for a new name would be something indicating that the package does
logging.  Maybe something with "log" included in it.  IMHO, the problem with
"cat" is that it is sufficiently general to include all manner of things in
addition to logging.

Keith,

How about "catlog"? Sounds much like catalog but I can't tell if that's 
good or bad. Cheers, Ceki

Frankly, I think "log4j" is perfectly fine.  You've developed name
recognition for it.  Changing the name has very little value.

Yeah, I think the name should stay Log4J too.

I vote to stay with Log4j. It is a familiar name to the industry, it has
appeared in Java World and talked about in many newsgroups. To change it
would mean a lot of confusion.

	How about sending me an email when it gets added to Apache.org, so I can
announce it on TheServerSide.com.

I guess we could be clever and, in keeping with the name Jakarta, try to
find an Indonesian word as the package name -- something either
conceptually-related or a language pun.
 
The JSR-0047 group wasn't particularly imaginative, but we might choose to
follow their lead. The package name that they currently propose is
java.util.logging. Our equivalent would be org.apache.logging.
 
Naming could be a concern given that log4j has just recently gotten some
good publicity with the publication of a 3rd party article in the Java
Developer's Journal and your article, Ceki, on JavaWorld. This move to
apache might be a good thing but I think we want to be sure to maintain some
trail of crumbs that leads anyone looking for log4j to the new package.
 
I'll have to give it more thought. 
Jim

Keith,

How about "catlog"? Sounds much like catalog but I can't tell if that's good
or bad. Cheers, Ceki

I guess we could be clever and, in keeping with the name Jakarta, try to
find an Indonesian word as the package name -- something either
conceptually-related or a language pun.
 
The JSR-0047 group wasn't particularly imaginative, but we might choose to
follow their lead. The package name that they currently propose is
java.util.logging. Our equivalent would be org.apache.logging.
 
Naming could be a concern given that log4j has just recently gotten some
good publicity with the publication of a 3rd party article in the Java
Developer's Journal and your article, Ceki, on JavaWorld. This move to
apache might be a good thing but I think we want to be sure to maintain some
trail of crumbs that leads anyone looking for log4j to the new package.
 
I'll have to give it more thought. 
Jim

Keith,

How about "catlog"? Sounds much like catalog but I can't tell if that's good
or bad. Cheers, Ceki

Hi Ceki,

I like very much the idea of Log4j going into Jakarta. I hope you feel =
very proud about that, I do - It just reinsures my selection of Log4j.
About the name - well, I kind of got used to log4j - but if you want cat =
I'm 'Miyahuing' right after you.

Cheers,=20

  Hi Guy,

  It's not public yet but since you have asked: yes, log4j should become =
a jakarta project in the next few days.=20

  There are now two new mailing lists: log4j-dev@jakarta.apache.org and =
log4j-user@jakarta.apache.org which replace the old log4j-dev@log4j.org =
and log4j-public@log4j.org mailing lists. The members of the old lists =
have been automatically subscribed to the corresponding list on =
jakarta.apache.org. The CVS repository has also moved to Apache.

  There is a strong push to rename the package to "org.apache.log4j". I =
have already committed to do this for the next major log4j release =
scheduled for 1Q 2001. If you have a good reason to oppose a name =
change, then let us know so that we can raise the issue with the apache =
group.  This is your chance to speak up.

I think keeping the log4j name is the best way to leave the trail of crumbs.
It is also consistent with what Apache has done with some other packages.
For instance, the ORO regular expression packages are now
"org.apache.oro.*". I think "org.apache.log4j" is fine. 

Of course, "org.apache.logging" is fine to me, as well. But I like keeping
that thread of continuity of having "log4j" in the name.

I guess we could be clever and, in keeping with the name Jakarta, try to
find an Indonesian word as the package name -- something either
conceptually-related or a language pun.
 
The JSR-0047 group wasn't particularly imaginative, but we might choose
to follow their lead. The package name that they currently propose is
java.util.logging. Our equivalent would be org.apache.logging.
 
Naming could be a concern given that log4j has just recently gotten some
good publicity with the publication of a 3rd party article in the Java
Developer's Journal and your article, Ceki, on JavaWorld. This move to
apache might be a good thing but I think we want to be sure to maintain
some trail of crumbs that leads anyone looking for log4j to the new
package.
 
I'll have to give it more thought.

Keith,

How about "catlog"? Sounds much like catalog but I can't tell if that's
good or bad. Cheers, Ceki

Hi Folks,

The Apache members have argued that the 4J suffix oozes with IBM. Moreover, 
as in any case the project code will be placed under "org.apache.XYZ", this 
is absolutely the best time to change the name of the project.

Even if we rename the project, http://www.log4j.org won't disappear and 
will point to the new project at Apache. Thus, the log4j name recognition 
argument, although very convincing at first,  does not hold much water (IMHO).

Here are some possible choices:

- org.apache.cat
- org.apache.pebble
- org.apache.grit

This is a reference to the Henzel and Gretel fairy tale. Logging is a lot 
like placing pebbles in a forest except that the forest is the application.

- org.apache.log4j          Duh!
- org.apache.logging      JSR47 copy cat.
- org.apache.log            This one is already taken by Peter Donald's 
LogKit in Avalon.
- org.apache.hlog          'H' for hierarchical.
- org.apache.moa          Moa is a teeny island at the edge of Indonesia.

You are encouraged to make new project name proposals but please do not 
vote yet. We'll vote after new proposals are made. Regards, Ceki

A name change is *guaranteed* to cause confusion, not least because people
won't understand WHY the name changed at all. Most project name-changes
reflect a change in focus, or implementation, or *something* more
substantial than someone's aversion to "IBM-like" names. Now you can leave
a trail pointing "log4j"-seekers to the new project, but.. that's just
harm minimization. Where's the compelling reason to cause the harm in the
first place?

I doubt if the log4c++ and log4p maintainers would support a name-change
either ;)

All missing the crucial word "log". Apache project names are famously
non-descriptive, but I don't think it's necessarily a good thing.

Hi!

I've just started using log4j. Seems nice, but I'm having this weird
problem. I'm using it with Tomcat in a framework we've devised.

At first things are perfectly OK, but after some log lines I start to get
multiple copies of the lines. It's exactly the same line, since it has the
same timestamp. After some time there is like thirty repetitions of each
logged message.

Anybody have any ideas?

One possible reason is that the configurator (BasicConfigurator.configure for
example) is called more than once.

When using Xerces and Xalan, I always have to stop and think what is the

I have to second that.  I like log4j because it's easy to guess what the
package does by it's name, and the "j" makes it obvious that this is a java
tool.
 
I don't even like naming a Category instance variable "category" because the
name is not very reflective of the fact that it is just used for logging.
 
If we were voting, I would vote to keep log4j, or else have some name with
"log" in it.

/usr/java/jsdk2.2/servlet.jar
/usr/java/third/webmacro/webmacro.jar
/usr/java/jaxp-1.1ea/crimson.jar
/usr/java/jaxp-1.1ea/jaxp.jar
/usr/java/jaxp-1.1ea/xalan.jar

------------
  I then try to run a class called Test. It's an adaption of the xerces
based XMLSample to jaxp1.1, and uses one of the config files there. Check
the log4j log entries at the bottom of the run here:

endre@endresin:~/testlog/classes$ java Test testconf1.xml 
"doc.getDocumentElement()" gives:

<configuration configDebug="null" disableOverride="null">

        <appender name="A1" class="org.log4j.FileAppender">
            <param name="File" value="A1.log" />
            <param name="Append" value="false" />
            <layout class="org.log4j.PatternLayout">
                <param name="ConversionPattern" value="%t %-5p %c{2} - %m\n" />
            </layout>
        </appender>
        
        <appender name="STDOUT" class="org.log4j.FileAppender">
                <param name="File" value="System.out" />
                
                <layout class="org.log4j.PatternLayout">
                   <param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d %-5p [%t] %C{2} (%F:%L) - %m\n" />
                </layout>
        </appender>
        
        <category name="Test" additivity="true">
          <priority value="debug" />
          <appender-ref ref="A1" />
        </category>
        
        <root>
           <priority value="debug" />
           <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
        </root>
        
</configuration>

log4j: No appender named [A1] could be found.
log4j: No appender named [STDOUT] could be found.
log4j: No appenders could be found for category (Test).
log4j: Please initialize the log4j system properly.

------------------ 

What's happening is apparently that these lines in DOMConfigurator.java
mess up (it does parse the root and categories "correctly", but when it
needs the appenders, it fails):

... 
Document doc = appenderRef.getOwnerDocument(); 
Element element = doc.getElementById(appenderName); 
if(element == null) {
    LogLog.error("No appender named ["+appenderName+"] could be found.");
    return null;
} else {
...

So, the getElementById isn't giving anything back. Why is this? I guess it
have something to do with me using jaxp1.1 and this being made for xerces,
but then there is something wrong somewhere, right?

Anybody had any experience with this?

Thanks!

Endre,

The DOMConfigurator requires the DOM Level 2 API which is not provided by=20
Sun's implementation of JAXP. So you need the Apache Xerces parser which=20
surprisingly also contains Sun's JAXP API... I hope this helps, Ceki

Thanks!

But it is a bit weird, since this is jaxp1.1 (Early Release, mind you!),
and it says in the doc:

" This release aims to be conformant to the following specifications: 

       JAXP 1.1 JSR-63 
       XML 1.0 Second Edition 
       XML Namespaces 
       SAX 2.0 
       SAX2 Extensions version 1.0 
       DOM Level 2 Core Recommendation 
       XSLT 1.0 "

But I hacked my way around it with this crude thing. I mean, it's just in
the _configuration_ that this is a problem, so it won't degrade the actual
logging performance anyway.

        /**
	 Used internally to parse appenders by IDREF.
	 */
	protected
		Appender findAppenderByReference(Element appenderRef) {
		String appenderName = appenderRef.getAttribute(REF_ATTR);
		Appender appender = (Appender) appenderBag.get(appenderName);
		if(appender != null) {
			return appender;
		} else {
			Document doc = appenderRef.getOwnerDocument();

			// DOESN'T WORK!! :
			// Element element = doc.getElementById(appenderName);
			
			// Endre's hack:
			Element element = null;
			NodeList list = doc.getElementsByTagName("appender");
			for (int t=0; t<list.getLength(); t++) {
				Node node = list.item(t);
				NamedNodeMap map= node.getAttributes();
				Node attrNode = map.getNamedItem("name");
				if (appenderName.equals(attrNode.getNodeValue())) {
					element = (Element) node;
					break;
				}
			}
			// Hack finished.
			
			if(element == null) {
				LogLog.error("No appender named ["+appenderName+"] could be found.");
				return null;
			} else {
				appender = parseAppender(element);
				appenderBag.put(appenderName, appender);
				return appender;
			}
		}
	}

Endre,

Your hack is obviously the right way to go. I don't know what I was=20
thinking when to require DOM Level 2 (getElementById method) when the same=
=20
effect can be achieved with a few lines of code. Thanks!. I'll modify the=20
code as you have suggested for the next version. Ceki

Hi again,

How about the name logi? The project motto would be: "logi is not logy." Is 
this reasonable or just plain silly? Cheers, Ceki

Hi all,

I am not sure, whether org.apache.logging will be a good idea. This will
imply, that log4j is "only" a different implementation of the SUN api.

If you, Ceki, would like to focus on compatibilty with this API, I would
propose to use it. But for my opinion, I think, log4j should be known as a
separate logging implementation with its own "brand" name and its own
features, as it is really more than the JSR 047.

I personally like log4j very much, and especially its corresponding log4?
implementations (like ?Unit...).

Bye, Jochen

Hello everyone,.

I have just started to implement a JMSAppedner. Would you recommend any one
of the following opensource implementations of JMS?
objectCube, Inc.
OpenJMS
ObjectWeb - Joram
spyderMQ
Thanks for the information. Ceki

I'll go with OpenJMS... but this is MHO only what I got from experiencing
with OpenJMS and SpyderM. 

I've never used the others product though.

OK. Thanks. In the mean time I started using Sun's JMQ1.1. I'll test my 
code with OpenJMS too. Cheers, Ceki

I think JMQ is a commercial product. Try SwiftMQ, that is no open source 
but its free also for comercial use.

Jaxp 1.1 isn't ready yet.  I think Ceki mentioned that earlier in the
mailing list, but I could be mistaken.

For now, we're stuck with single-sourcing the XML parser (Xerces... At a
700K footprint), although DOMConfigurator could be rewritten to use a hollo=
w
replacement approach:

- For every ID encountered in the config file, add the constructed componen=
t
into a hashtable using the value of the ID attribute as the key
- For every IDREF encountered in the config file, lookup the associated
object from the hashtable.  If that association has not been made (the ID'd
component comes later in the document), defer the construction of the
component until later (add it to a stack?)
- Once the file has been completely traversed, revisit the deferred
components

This solution is convoluted and error-prone, which is why (IMHO) Ceki chose
to require DOM level 2 so he could safely search the document after each
encountered IDREF.

The only limitation to the new system that I am aware of is if you're
residing within an application server (such as Jakarta's Tomcat) and you tr=
y
and use DOM level 2 interface bindings.  Since Tomcat uses JAXP (AFAIK) for
loading the server's configuration file information, only the DOM level 1
bindings are loaded (and anything using Log4j's DOMConfigurator will crash)=
.
The solution is replacing the parser.jar from Sun with the xerces.jar from
xml.apache.org in your Tomcat lib directory.

Hello,

This problem is corrected in log4j 1.0 such that the DOMConfigurator will=20
require only DOM Level 1 instead of DOM Level 2.

If you can't wait until 1.0 is released, then try the hack suggested by=20
Endre St=F8lsvik <Endre@Stolsvik.com> which works very well:

/**
    Used internally to parse appenders by IDREF.
*/
protected
Appender findAppenderByReference(Element appenderRef) {
   String appenderName =3D appenderRef.getAttribute(REF_ATTR);
   Appender appender =3D (Appender) appenderBag.get(appenderName);
   if(appender !=3D null) {
     return appender;
   } else {
     Document doc =3D appenderRef.getOwnerDocument();


     // DOESN'T WORK!! :
     // Element element =3D doc.getElementById(appenderName);

     // Endre's hack:
     Element element =3D null;
     NodeList list =3D doc.getElementsByTagName("appender");
     for (int t=3D0; t<list.getLength(); t++) {
       Node node =3D list.item(t);
       NamedNodeMap map=3D node.getAttributes();
       Node attrNode =3D map.getNamedItem("name");
       if (appenderName.equals(attrNode.getNodeValue())) {
         element =3D (Element) node;
         break;
       }
     }
     // Hack finished.

     if(element =3D=3D null) {
       LogLog.error("No appender named ["+appenderName+"] could be found.");
       return null;
     } else {
       appender =3D parseAppender(element);
       appenderBag.put(appenderName, appender);
       return appender;
     }
   }
}

This fixes the jaxp parser problem.

Chris' explanation is right on target. Endre's solution, that is=20
replacing  getElementById with an equivalent for loop, is exactly the right=
=20
approach. I must have been very confused when switching to the DOM level 2=
=20
API. :-)

Hope this helps, Ceki

Hi,

I tried the Sort.java example file with sort3.lcf.  The messages did get
logged to the server process.  However, I notice that as soon as the
client is exit, there is an exception thrown on the server console:

Aston,

The exception is informational. (It is caught.)

If you are bothered by it for esthetic reasons, then set the priority of 
the category named  "org.log4j.net.SocketNode" to a value higher than INFO. 
Hope this helps, Ceki

Hi,

I am trying to figure out how to get Log4J to work with a properties file which I have created and
I am having a bit of a problem. I think I have done everything correctly but Log4J can't find my
properties file. I have created a class called Test with the following code in the Main:

  PropertyConfigurator.configure("LogSetting");
  Category cat=Category.getInstance("test");
  cat.info("Info Entry");
  cat.warn("Warn entry");
  cat.error("Error entry");
  cat.debug("Debug entry");

I have also created a properties file called "LogSetting.properties" and placed it with the test
class file. I have checked and this is on my class path. The properties file consists of:

log4j.configDebug=true
log4j.appender.A1=org.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.A1.File=System.out

log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, A1

log4j.appender.A1.layout=org.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=%-4r [%t] %-5p %c %x-%m%n


When I run my test program I get the following error:


log4j: Could not read configuration file [LogSetting].
java.io.FileNotFoundException: LogSetting (The system cannot find the file specified)

Any ideas or help in getting this to work will be greatly appreciated.

Alex

Alex -

I don't know if this will address your problem, but...

I have a method that takes a ResourceBundle and returns a Properties object:

    static public Properties getPropertiesFromResourceBundle(
            ResourceBundle bundle)
    {
        Properties props = new Properties();

        Enumeration keys = bundle.getKeys();

        while( keys.hasMoreElements()) {
            String key = (String) keys.nextElement();
            String val = bundle.getString( key);
            props.setProperty( key, val);
        }

        return props;
    }


Then I call it something like this:

ResourceBundle logProps = ResourceBundle.getBundle( "com.fgm.TrackerRes");
Properties props = AggregationUtils.getPropertiesFromResourceBundle(
logProps);
PropertyConfigurator.configure( props);

I think I went to that trouble because I wanted to take advantage of
ResourceBundle.getBundle()'s automatic scanning of the classpath for the
file, and its locale functionality.

I may be exposing a major misunderstanding on my part of how log4j works.  I
welcome any comments on the above.

Alex,

When you call the PropertyConfigurator.configure() the argument must match 
the name of the file.
So, the call should 
be  PropertyConfigurator.configure("LogSetting.properties");

Hope this helps, Ceki

ps: To see what log4j is doing, define the system property 
log4j.configDebug as in

    java -Dlog4j.configDebug your.application

Keith,

You might want to try Class.getResource instead of ResourceBundle. Regards, 
Ceki

Hi, thanks but that did not help. I don't get what the problem is. I am using JBuilder and as I
run my test app JBuilder prints to the screen the class path. I can see that my classes directory
is in the path. Within that directory I have a file called "LogSetting.properties." I have tried:

PropertyConfigurator.configure("LogSetting.properties");

but that has not helped, the file still can not be found. Any ideas what else could be the
problem?

Ah, I got it to work. Even though classes is in the class path the properties file needed to be
one directory above classes. Don't know why, don't care. At least I know where to put the
properties file from now on.

It seems that it is looking for the file in the current direcotry of 
JBuilder. Try using the full path.

I'm not sure but the search in the class path is only done when loading 
the default configuration file (log4j.properties)
